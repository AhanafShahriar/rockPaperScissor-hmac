# Cryptographic Rock-Paper-Scissors (HMAC-based)

This project implements a generalized Rock-Paper-Scissors game with cryptographic proof of fairness using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code). The game supports any odd number of arbitrary moves and ensures the computer's move is not altered after the player's choice.

## Features
- Supports an arbitrary odd number of moves (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock).
- Cryptographically strong random key generation for HMAC.
- Fairness guarantee using HMAC to ensure the computer does not change its move after the player makes a choice.
- Elegant help table with win/lose/draw rules.
- Command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction.
- Error handling for incorrect or invalid inputs.
